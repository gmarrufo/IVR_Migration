The <Set> element also enables the application developer to evaluate expressions
The syntax for expressions is described in the chapter on expressions

The following example sets a variable value: <Set var="varname" expr="A literal string"/>
To evaluate an expression, enclose the expression inside parenthesis. For example:
The following example evaluates an expression: <Set var="varname" expr="(expression)"/>
In the above example, "expression" is any valid expression as described in the section on expressions
Note: To evaluate an expression, the expr attribute must begin AND end with parenthesis. If there is a space at the beginning or end, it will not be evaluated as an expression, it will be treated as a literal string
